## What is a TDU?

### Definition

A **Transmission and Distribution Utility (TDU)** is a regulated entity that owns, operates, and maintains the physical electrical infrastructure delivering power from generation sources to homes and businesses.

### Responsibilities

- **Transmission**: High-voltage power lines carrying electricity across regions
- **Distribution**: Local infrastructure (poles, transformers, service lines) to individual premises
- **Metering**: Installation and maintenance of electric meters
- **Outage Response**: Emergency repairs and restoration
- **Vegetation Management**: Tree trimming and right-of-way maintenance

### What TDUs Do NOT Do

- Generate electricity
- Sell retail electricity plans
- Set retail electricity prices
- Handle customer billing for energy charges

### Regulatory Oversight

All TDU rates are regulated by the **Public Utility Commission of Texas (PUCT)** through formal tariff proceedings. Rates must be cost-justified and approved before implementation.

---

## TDU Rate Structures

### Components of TDU Charges

All Texas TDUs use a **two-part tariff** structure (except LP&L which uses one-part):

1. **Monthly Base Charge (Customer Charge)**: Fixed fee per meter per month
   - Covers: Meter reading, billing systems, customer service, fixed infrastructure costs
   - Range: $0.00 (LP&L) to $7.85 (TNMP)

2. **Per-kWh Delivery Charge**: Variable charge per kilowatt-hour delivered
   - Covers: Transmission costs, distribution losses, maintenance, vegetation management
   - Range: 5.30¢ (AEP North) to 6.31¢ (LP&L)

### Total TDU Cost Formula

```bash
Monthly TDU Cost = Base Charge + (Usage in kWh × Per-kWh Rate ÷ 100)

Example (Oncor, 1,000 kWh):
  = $4.23 + (1000 × 5.5833 ÷ 100)
  = $4.23 + $55.83
  = $60.06
```

### TDU Cost as Percentage of Total Bill

At typical usage (1,000 kWh) and average retail rate (12¢/kWh):

```bash
Total Bill = $120
TDU Charges = $60
TDU Percentage = 50%
```

**Insight:** Half your bill is TDU delivery charges, which are identical across all REPs in your area. This is why comparing true total costs (not just "energy rates") is critical.
