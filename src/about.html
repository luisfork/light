            <h2>How Texas Electricity Actually Works</h2>
            <p>
                Texas operates the nation's only competitive retail electricity market, where
                <strong>over 300 Retail Electric Providers (REPs)</strong> compete for customers
                across 173 deregulated counties. Understanding this three-layer structure is
                essential to choosing the right plan.
            </p>

            <h3>The Three Players</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    <strong>ERCOT</strong> (Electric Reliability Council of Texas) manages the grid
                    and wholesale electricity market, serving 85-90% of Texas load.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>REPs</strong> (Retail Electric Providers) purchase wholesale electricity
                    and sell retail plans. They set your rates, handle billing, and provide customer service.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>TDUs</strong> (Transmission and Distribution Utilities) own the physical
                    infrastructure (poles and wires). They charge regulated delivery fees that appear
                    on every bill regardless of which REP you choose.
                </li>
            </ul>

            <h3>The Six Major TDUs</h3>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Oncor</strong> - Dallas-Fort Worth area (7.5 million customers, largest)</li>
                <li><strong>CenterPoint Energy</strong> - Houston and surrounding areas</li>
                <li><strong>AEP Texas Central</strong> - Corpus Christi and Rio Grande Valley</li>
                <li><strong>AEP Texas North</strong> - Abilene and San Angelo</li>
                <li><strong>Texas-New Mexico Power (TNMP)</strong> - Scattered areas including Galveston</li>
                <li><strong>Lubbock Power & Light</strong> - Lubbock (joined deregulation in January 2024)</li>
            </ul>

            <div class="callout-box">
                <strong>Note:</strong> Major cities like Austin, San Antonio, and El Paso remain
                regulated with municipal utilities and do not participate in the deregulated market.

            <h2>Why Fixed-Rate Plans Win for Most Texans</h2>
            <p>
                Fixed-rate plans lock your price per kilowatt-hour for the entire contract duration
                (typically 6 to 36 months). They consistently outperform alternatives for three key reasons:
            </p>

            <h3>Price Predictability</h3>
            <p>
                Fixed rates shield you from market volatility. During Winter Storm Uri in February 2021,
                variable-rate plans spiked into thousands of dollars per kWh, bankrupting some customers.
                Fixed-rate customers were protected.
            </p>

            <h3>Lowest Overall Costs</h3>
            <p>
                Despite marketing claims, fixed-rate plans typically cost less annually than variable,
                indexed, or time-of-use plans for most households.
            </p>

            <h3>Budget Stability</h3>
            <p>
                Knowing your rate won't change makes financial planning straightforward. You can
                accurately predict your electricity costs for the entire contract term.
            </p>

            <h3>The Primary Drawback: Early Termination Fees</h3>
            <p>
                Fixed-rate plans typically charge <strong>$150-$300 ETFs</strong> if you cancel early.
                However, Texas law prohibits ETFs if you move outside the provider's service area
                (with proof of relocation).

        <article class="about-section">
            <h2>Reading the Electricity Facts Label (EFL)</h2>
            <p>
                The <strong>Electricity Facts Label</strong> is your most important tool, mandated by
                PUCT Substantive Rule §25.475 to standardize plan disclosures. Every EFL must display
                the average price per kWh at three usage levels:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>500 kWh</strong> - Low-usage apartments</li>
                <li><strong>1,000 kWh</strong> - Texas benchmark (median household)</li>
                <li><strong>2,000 kWh</strong> - Larger homes with heavy AC usage</li>
            </ul>

            <div class="callout-box">
                <strong>Critical Insight:</strong> These prices include TDU delivery charges.
                They represent your total expected cost per kWh, not just the energy rate.
            </div>

            <h3>Key EFL Sections to Scrutinize</h3>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Energy Charge:</strong> The per-kWh rate for electricity supply</li>
                <li><strong>Base Charge:</strong> Fixed monthly fee regardless of usage ($0-$30)</li>
                <li><strong>Bill Credits:</strong> Discounts conditional on hitting usage thresholds</li>
                <li><strong>Early Termination Fee:</strong> Flat amount or per-month-remaining formula</li>
                <li><strong>Renewable Content:</strong> Percentage from renewable sources (Texas average ~33%)</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>How to Calculate Your Expected Bill</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>Multiply energy charge by your kWh usage</li>
                <li>Add base charge</li>
                <li>Add TDU charges (both fixed and per-kWh components)</li>
                <li>Subtract any bill credits you'll actually qualify for</li>
                <li>Add local sales tax (if applicable)</li>
            </ol>

            <h2>The Bill Credit Trap Costs $800+ Annually</h2>
            <p>
                An EnergyBot study of over 500 Texas residents found bill credit plans were
                <strong>34% more expensive per kWh</strong> than traditional fixed-rate plans,
                costing customers an average of <strong>$816 more annually</strong>.
            </p>

            <div class="warning-box">
                <strong>How Bill Credits Work (And Fail):</strong> These plans offer deceptively
                low advertised rates by providing large credits (typically $100-$125) only if you
                use exactly 1,000 kWh. Miss that narrow target, and you pay dramatically higher rates.
            </div>

            <h3>Why They Fail in Practice</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    <strong>Seasonal Variation:</strong> Summer consumption often reaches 1,500-2,500 kWh
                    while fall months drop to 800-900 kWh. You'll miss the credit threshold 8-10 months per year.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Narrow Windows:</strong> Credits typically require usage within a 50 kWh window
                    (e.g., 1,000-1,050 kWh). This is nearly impossible to hit consistently.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Penalty Rates:</strong> Missing the credit threshold by even 50 kWh triggers
                    effective rates of 22-23¢/kWh vs. 9-10¢/kWh for simple fixed plans.
                </li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Free Nights &amp; Weekends Plans</h3>
            <p>
                These suffer similar problems. Unless you use more than <strong>65% of electricity
                during free hours</strong>, you'll pay more than a standard fixed-rate plan. Most
                households achieve only 25-35% off-peak usage.
            </p>
            <p>
                Daytime rates on "Free Nights" plans run 18-19¢/kWh versus ~9¢ on standard fixed plans.

        <article class="about-section">
            <h2>TDU Charges Add 30-40% to Every Bill</h2>
            <p>
                TDU delivery charges are <strong>unavoidable and identical</strong> across all REPs
                in your territory. They're regulated pass-through costs approved by the PUCT.

            <h2>Strategic Shopping Saves 15-25%</h2>
            <h3>Best Months to Shop</h3>
            <p>
                <strong>April, May, and October</strong> offer the lowest rates—15-25% below peak
                season pricing. Electricity providers compete aggressively during low-demand months.
            </p>

            <h3>Worst Months to Shop</h3>
            <p>
                <strong>July, August, and January</strong> see rates spike up to 40% higher due
                to extreme weather demand.
            </p>

            <h3>Contract Expiration Strategy</h3>
            <p>
                If your contract expires during peak season, consider an odd-term plan (8, 9, or 14 months)
                to shift future renewals to favorable months. A 9-month plan starting in January expires
                in September/October when rates are lowest.

                <strong>The Holdover Rate Trap:</strong> If you do nothing when your contract expires,
                you're automatically placed on a variable "holdover rate" that's typically 20-50% higher
                than contracted rates. Most Texans save $200-500 annually simply by switching at renewal.
